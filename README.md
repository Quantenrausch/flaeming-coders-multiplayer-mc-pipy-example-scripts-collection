This is a collecton of Python scripts for Minecraft from all around the net. My son an I worked them to learn about MC coding and Python coding at all. The original sources should be in the scripts. The repository includes the Pi API to work with Minecraft Pi Edition running on Raspberry Pi, or alternatively on a CraftBukkit server using the RaspberryJuice plugin, or RaspberryJamMod (some only work on RaspberryJamMod, some need pygame).

The scripts are unmodified with a few exceptions to make them work in an multiplayer dedicated server environment:

1. Added network server connection information module (edit "_mp_ds_config.py")
2. Made necessary code changes to make it work for multiple player on one server

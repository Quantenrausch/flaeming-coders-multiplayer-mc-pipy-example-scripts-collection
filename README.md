Python scripts for controlling Minecraft Pi Edition on Raspberry Pi, many of them as highlighted at mcpipy.com

This is a collection of python scripts that can be used to control Minecraft Pi Edition running on Raspberry Pi, 
or alternatively on a CraftBukkit server using the RaspberryJuice plugin, or RaspberryJamMod (some only work
on RaspberryJamMod).

All of the scripts are NOT of my own creation, but rather were created by others and collected to 
make it easy for others to enjoy them. The scripts are unmodified with a few exceptions:

1. Added network server connection information file 
2. Added nessecery import statements to the files 
2. Mincraft object creation was changed to be used in multiplayer user environment
